### Recipe Content Structure

Organize your recipe markdown with standard sections:

## Ingredients

- 2 cups flour
- 1 cup sugar
- 1/2 cup butter

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 350°F
2. Mix dry ingredients
3. Add wet ingredients
4. Bake for 12 minutes

## Tips

- Use room temperature butter for best results
- Don't overbake... cookies continue cooking after removal
```

## Customization

### Custom Fonts

The theme uses the Leila font family for a handwritten aesthetic. The fonts are included in `static/fonts/`.

### Gingham Pattern Customizer

Desktop users can personalize the gingham background pattern using the palette button in the bottom right corner (stacked above the cursor selector). Customization options include:

- **Color**: Choose any color using the color picker
- **Opacity**: Adjust from 0-100% for subtle or bold patterns
- **Stripe Thickness**: Control the size of the gingham checks (10-50px)
- **Live Preview**: See changes in real-time before applying
- **Reset**: Restore default pattern (red at 15% opacity, 20px stripes)

Settings are automatically saved to localStorage and persist across sessions. A hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R / Cmd+Shift+R) will reset to defaults.

### Custom Cursors

Desktop users can choose from several food-themed cursors:

- Default arrow
- Apple
- Berry
- Cake
- Cherry
- Coffee
- Muffin
- Pear

Cursor images are located in `static/images/cursors/`.

### Mascot Graphics

The header features animated food mascot graphics located in `static/images/mascots/`.

### Styling

The main stylesheet is located at `static/css/style.css`. To override styles, create a `assets/css/custom.css` in your site root and add:

```toml
[params]
  customCSS = ["css/custom.css"]
```

## Multilingual Setup

The theme includes complete translations for English and Spanish. Language persistence is handled automatically - users' language selections are saved across sessions.

To add additional languages:

1. Create a new language file in `i18n/` (e.g., `i18n/fr.yaml`)
2. Copy the structure from `i18n/en.yaml` and translate all keys
3. Add the language configuration to your `hugo.toml`

## Development

### JavaScript Modules

The theme includes four main JavaScript modules:

- `filter.js` - Recipe filtering and search functionality
- `cursor-selector.js` - Custom cursor selection interface
- `gingham-customizer.js` - Background pattern customization interface
- `language-persistence.js` - Language preference management
